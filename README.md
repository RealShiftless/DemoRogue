# DemoRogue
Small roguelike game demo I'm building along side my 2D Oldschool console inspired graphics engine [Shiftless.Clockwork.Retro](https://github.com/RealShiftless/Shiftless.Clockwork.Retro).
It still needs some more comments and so far is only a dungeon generator tbh.
But it's steadily making progress!
